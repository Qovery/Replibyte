## Usage

[![What is RepliByte](assets/video_.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKeLnZvECQw)

Example with PostgreSQL as a _Source_ and _Destination_ database **AND** S3 as a _Bridge_ (cf [configuration file](#Configuration))

### Create a dev database dataset from your production database

<details>

<summary>Show me</summary>

```shell
replibyte -c prod-conf.yaml backup run
```

*The backup is compressed and stored on your S3 bucket (cf [configuration](#configuration)).*

</details>

### Create a dev database dataset from a dump file

<details>

<summary>Show me</summary>

```shell
cat dump.sql | replibyte -c prod-conf.yaml backup run -s postgres -i
```

*The backup is compressed and stored on your S3 bucket (cf [configuration](#configuration)).*

</details>

### Seed my local database (Docker required)

<details>

<summary>Show me</summary>

List all your backups to choose one:

```shell
replibyte -c prod-conf.yaml backup list

type          name                    size    when                    compressed  encrypted
PostgreSQL    backup-1647706359405    154MB   Yesterday at 03:00 am   true        true
PostgreSQL    backup-1647731334517    152MB   2 days ago at 03:00 am  true        true
PostgreSQL    backup-1647734369306    149MB   3 days ago at 03:00 am  true        true
```

Restore the latest one into a Postgres container bound on 5433 (default: 5432) port:

```shell
replibyte -c prod-conf.yaml restore local -v latest --image postgres --port 5433

To connect to your Postgres database, use the following connection string:
> postgres://postgres:password@localhost:5433/postgres
Waiting for Ctrl-C to stop the container
```

OR restore a specific one:

```
replibyte -c prod-conf.yaml restore local -v backup-1647706359405 --image postgres --port 5433
```

</details>

*The seed comes from your S3 bucket (cf [configuration](#configuration))*

### Seed a remote database

<details>

<summary>Show me</summary>

Show your backups:

```shell
replibyte -c prod-conf.yaml backup list

type          name                    size    when                    compressed  encrypted
PostgreSQL    backup-1647706359405    154MB   Yesterday at 03:00 am   true        true
PostgreSQL    backup-1647731334517    152MB   2 days ago at 03:00 am  true        true
PostgreSQL    backup-1647734369306    149MB   3 days ago at 03:00 am  true        true
```

Restore the latest one:

```shell
replibyte -c prod-conf.yaml restore remote -v latest
```

OR restore a specific one:

```
replibyte -c prod-conf.yaml restore remote -v backup-1647706359405
```

*The seed comes from your S3 bucket (cf [configuration](#configuration))*

</details>

### Configuration

Create your `prod-conf.yaml` configuration file to source your production database.

```yaml
encryption_key: $MY_PRIVATE_ENC_KEY # optional - encrypt data on bridge
source:
  connection_uri: $DATABASE_URL
  database_subset: # optional - downscale database while keeping it consistent
    database: public
    table: orders
    strategy_name: random
    strategy_options:
      percent: 50
    passthrough_tables:
      - us_states
  transformers: # optional - hide sensitive data
    - database: public
      table: employees
      columns:
        - name: last_name
          transformer_name: random
        - name: birth_date
          transformer_name: random-date
        - name: first_name
          transformer_name: first-name
        - name: email
          transformer_name: email
        - name: username
          transformer_name: keep-first-char
    - database: public
      table: customers
      columns:
        - name: phone
          transformer_name: phone-number
bridge:
  bucket: $BUCKET_NAME
  region: $S3_REGION
  access_key_id: $ACCESS_KEY_ID
  secret_access_key: $AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
```

Run the app for the source

```shell
replibyte -c prod-conf.yaml
```

### Destination

Create your `staging-conf.yaml` configuration file to sync your production database with your staging database.

```yaml
bridge:
  bucket: $BUCKET_NAME
  region: $S3_REGION
  access_key_id: $ACCESS_KEY_ID
  secret_access_key: $AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
destination:
  connection_uri: $DATABASE_URL
encryption_key: $MY_PRIVATE_ENC_KEY # optional - needed to decrypt data on bridge if there was an encryption_key defined when running the source backup
```

Run the app for the destination

```shell
replibyte -c staging-conf.yaml
```

## Connectors

### Supported Source connectors

## Motivation

At [Qovery](https://www.qovery.com) (the company behind RepliByte), developers can clone their applications and databases just with one
click. However, the cloning process can be tedious and time-consuming, and we end up copying the information multiple times. With RepliByte,
the Qovery team wants to provide a comprehensive way to seed cloud databases from one place to another.

The long-term motivation behind RepliByte is to provide a way to clone any database in real-time. This project starts small, but has big
ambition!

## FAQ

### Q: Does RepliByte is an ETL?

<details>

<summary>Answer</summary>

RepliByte is not an ETL like [AirByte](https://github.com/airbytehq/airbyte), [AirFlow](https://airflow.apache.org/), Talend, and it will
never be. If you need to synchronize versatile data sources, you are better choosing a classic ETL. RepliByte is a tool for software
engineers to help them to synchronize data from the same databases. With RepliByte, you can only replicate data from the same type of
databases. As mentioned above, the primary purpose of RepliByte is to duplicate into different environments. You can see RepliByte as a
specific use case of an ETL, where an ETL is more generic.

</details>

### Q: Do you support backup from a dump file?

<details>

<summary>Answer</summary>

absolutely,

```shell
cat dump.sql | replibyte -c prod-conf.yaml backup run -s postgres -i
```

and

```shell
replibyte -c prod-conf.yaml backup run -s postgres -f dump.sql
```

</details>

### How RepliByte can list the backups? Is there an API?

<details>

<summary>Answer</summary>

There is no API, RepliByte is fully stateless and store the backup list into the bridge (E.g. S3) via an [index_file](#index-file-structure)
.

## Local development

For local development, you will need to install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and run `docker compose -f ./docker-compose-dev.yml` to
start the local databases. At the moment, `docker-compose` includes 2 PostgreSQL database instances, 2 MySQL instances, 2 MongoDB instances
and a [MinIO](https://min.io/) bridge. One source, one destination by database and one bridge. In the future, we will provide more options.

The Minio console is accessible at http://localhost:9001.

Once your Docker instances are running, you can run the RepliByte tests, to check if everything is configured correctly:

```shell
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=minioadmin AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=minioadmin cargo test
```
