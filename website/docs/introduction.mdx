## Motivation

At [Qovery](https://www.qovery.com) (the company behind Replibyte), developers can clone their applications and databases just with one
click. However, the cloning process can be tedious and time-consuming, and we end up copying the information multiple times. With RepliByte,
the Qovery team wants to provide a comprehensive way to seed cloud databases from one place to another.

The long-term motivation behind RepliByte is to provide a way to clone any database in real-time. This project starts small, but has big
ambition!
